# Data Model: Fix Linting Errors

**Feature**: 005-fix-linting-errors
**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Status**: N/A

## Overview

This feature is a code quality improvement that does not introduce, modify, or remove any data entities. All changes are limited to code formatting, type validation, and style compliance.

## Impact Assessment

### No Data Changes

- **No new entities**: No data structures added
- **No modified entities**: Existing data structures unchanged
- **No removed entities**: No data structures deleted
- **No schema changes**: Database schema unaffected (frontend-only)
- **No API changes**: No changes to request/response payloads
- **No state management changes**: Redux/context/local state structures unchanged

## Rationale for N/A Status

This document exists to explicitly confirm that no data modeling work is required for this feature. Code quality improvements (linting, formatting, accessibility, type validation) do not affect data architecture.
