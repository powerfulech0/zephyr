# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Poll Creation Response Handling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is clear and ready for planning.

**Key Points**:
- The bug is a mismatch between backend API response structure (flat) and frontend expectations (nested poll object)
- The fix requires updating the frontend to correctly handle the actual API response format
- Success is measured by error elimination and continued functionality of all existing features
